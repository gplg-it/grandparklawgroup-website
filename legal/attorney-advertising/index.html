                <p>The use of this website, including submission of any contact form, email correspondence, or telephone inquiry, does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Grand Park Law Group.

            <p>Do not transmit confidential or sensitive information through this website or by any other means until we have agreed to represent you and confirmed that agreement in writing.

Not all attorneys are licensed to practice in all jurisdictions. The transmission or receipt of information through this website or through any form of communication does not constitute an offer or agreement to provide legal services in any jurisdiction where such practice would violate applicable rules of professional conduct.</p>

            <p>No attorney at Grand Park Law Group is certified as a specialist by the State Bar of California Board of Legal Specialization unless explicitly stated on the attorney's individual biography page. Descriptions of practice areas or areas of focus on this website do not constitute certification or specialization claims.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Illinois</h3>
            <p>Grand Park Law Group maintains a presence in Chicago, Illinois. Any attorneys licensed in Illinois are identified on their biography pages. This website is not intended to, and does not, constitute a solicitation of clients in the State of Illinois except to the extent permitted by the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct. Pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules, this website constitutes attorney advertising.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Other Jurisdictions</h3>
            <p>This website is not intended to solicit legal business in any jurisdiction where such solicitation would not comply with applicable rules of professional conduct. If you require legal assistance in a jurisdiction where our attorneys are not licensed, we may refer you to qualified counsel in the appropriate jurisdiction or, where permitted, may associate with local counsel to assist with your matter.</p>

            <!-- 6. PRACTICE AREA DESCRIPTIONS -->

            <p>The practice area descriptions on this website are provided for informational purposes only and describe the general types of legal matters that our attorneys handle. These descriptions do not constitute representations of specialization, certification, or expertise beyond what is permitted by the applicable rules of professional conduct in each jurisdiction where our attorneys are licensed.</p>
            <p>Unless specifically stated otherwise on an attorney's biography page, no attorney at Grand Park Law Group claims certification or specialization by any state bar or other recognized authority. References to "expertise," "experience," or "focus" in a particular area of law describe the types of matters in which the attorney practices and should not be construed as a claim of specialization or certification.</p>

            <!-- 7. WEBSITE CONTENT -->
            <h2>7. Website Content and Communications</h2>
            <p>All content on this website, including but not limited to attorney biographies, practice area descriptions, case results, articles, blog posts, and newsletters, constitutes a "communication" within the meaning of California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 7.1. In accordance with Rule 7.1, no communication on this website is false, misleading, or deceptive, and no communication contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the communication considered as a whole not materially misleading.</p>
            <p>The information on this website may not reflect the most current legal developments, and we disclaim any obligation to update previously published content. The content on this website should not be relied upon as a substitute for legal advice from a licensed attorney who is knowledgeable about the law in your jurisdiction and your specific legal matter.</p>

            <!-- 8. SOCIAL MEDIA -->
            <h2>8. Social Media and Third-Party Platforms</h2>
            <p>Grand Park Law Group may maintain profiles on social media and professional networking platforms, including LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter). Content posted on these platforms is subject to the same advertising and communication rules as this website. Any interaction on social media platforms does not establish an attorney-client relationship, and confidential information should never be communicated through social media channels.</p>

            <h2>9. Free Consultation</h2>
            <p>References to "free consultation" on this website mean that an initial telephone or in-person discussion regarding the general nature of your legal matter is available at no charge. A free consultation does not guarantee that the Firm will agree to represent you or that your matter will proceed beyond the initial evaluation. The Firm reserves the right to decline representation at any time and for any reason, including the results of a conflicts check. A free consultation does not create an attorney-client relationship.</p>

            <!-- 10. FEE INFORMATION -->
            <h2>10. Fee Information</h2>
            <p>The Firm handles certain matters on a contingency fee basis, meaning that legal fees are contingent upon recovering compensation for the client. In contingency fee cases, the client pays no attorney's fees unless and until a recovery is obtained. However, clients may be responsible for costs and expenses regardless of the outcome. The specific terms of any fee arrangement will be set forth in a written engagement letter.</p>
            <p>Not all matters are handled on a contingency fee basis. The Firm's fee arrangements vary depending on the nature of the matter and are governed by the terms of the applicable written engagement agreement. The Firm complies with all applicable rules regarding fee agreements, including California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.5 (Fees for Legal Services) and Business and Professions Code Section 6147 (contingency fees) and Section 6148 (non-contingency fees).</p>
