("Grand Park," "we," "us," or "our"), completing a contact form, or otherwise interacting with this website does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and Grand Park Law Group or any of its attorneys.</p>
            <p>An attorney-client relationship with Grand Park Law Group is established only when: (a) you and the firm have executed a written engagement letter or retainer agreement; (b) the firm has performed a conflicts check and determined that no conflict of interest exists; and (c) the firm has expressly agreed to represent you in a specific matter.</p>
            <p>Until such a relationship is formally established, you should not transmit confidential or sensitive information to us through this website or by any other means, as any information sent may not be protected by the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.</p>
